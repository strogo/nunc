**No more procastination!**

Nunc is a free software cross-platform task management tool designed to handle your tasks and ideas with simplicity and avoiding procastination.

Nunc is easy and fast with features like automatic task locking, clipboard integration and full git-like experience.

**What? What does 'nunc' mean?** It is Latin for 'today'. Instead of 'for tomorrow' (that's what procrastinare means), do it now. Whatever it is.

## Status

It works but use at **your own risk**. I'll try to keep releases as compatible as possible, with proper database migrations (nunc uses [cznic/ql](https://github.com/cznic/ql) internally alongside a git-like dot directory layout).
